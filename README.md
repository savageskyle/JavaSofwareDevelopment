How to Use

Lab1:

Set up your matrices:

Open the Main class.
Define your matrices A and B directly in the main method. Ensure they are compatible for multiplication (i.e., the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B).
```
double[][] A = {
    {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
    {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
    {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
};

double[][] B = {
    {9.0, 8.0, 7.0},
    {6.0, 5.0, 4.0},
    {3.0, 2.0, 1.0}
};
```
Run the program
